# star_catalogue

This Star Catalogue project was developed for storage and visualisation of astro-
nomical objects. It serves as an elementary database management system for observed
astronomical objects. The use of object-oriented programming allowed for a stream-
lined approach to a large set of data and the simplification of the implementation of a
user interface with various functionalities. Data is input manually or from a file and
is manipulated and then visualised graphically and with a written report. Objects can
be searched on the database. Exploiting the polymorphism and inheritance aspects of
the C++ language allowed for an efficient and uncomplicated code.
